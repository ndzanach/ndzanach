👋 Hi, I’m Charles Ndzana,

Experienced Cloud & DevOps Architect with over 5 years of designing scalable, reliable infrastructure across AWS and, more recently, GCP — now extending that expertise to include AI-powered systems. I build solutions that don’t just work — they make sense. From architecture to automation (and intelligent tools), clarity drives everything I do.

🧩 What I Can Help You With (and Tools I Use):

• ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure Design & Deployment

  → AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, Cognito, Elastic Beanstalk)
  
  → GCP (Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, Storage, Alerting)

• 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

  → Terraform for modular, reusable, and version-controlled infrastructure
  
  → AWS CloudFormation

• 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Setup & Optimisation

  → GitHub Actions
  
  → Automating builds, tests, and deployments for fast and safe delivery

• 🐳 Docker Containerisation & Orchestration

  → Docker, Docker Compose, Elastic Beanstalk (multi-container)
  
  → Deploying local apps to the cloud, resolving container network and scaling issues

• 🧬 Backend API Development

  → Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express)
  
  → Designing REST APIs and building full serverless systems using API Gateway, Lambda, Cognito, S3, and CloudFront
  
  → CI/CD automation, secure token-based auth (JWT, OAuth2)

• 🤖 Automation, AI Integration & Scripting

  → Python scripts, Bash, Makefiles, AWS CLI
  
  → Automating tasks and simplifying workflows
  
  → Deploying and managing AI/ML models in containerized environments
  
  → Integrating LLM APIs or custom AI models into backend infrastructure (e.g., FastAPI + LangChain + Lambda)

• 📈 System Monitoring, Logging, & Performance Tuning

  → CloudWatch

• 🔧 Legacy Infrastructure Refactoring & Documentation

  → Modularising, simplifying, and cleaning up outdated or undocumented environments

• 🔐 Authentication & Access Management

  → AWS Cognito, IAM roles, OAuth2 standards, secure API access flows
  
  → GCP IAM policy design, role-based access control, and least-privilege enforcement

• 🗂️ Version Control & Collaboration

  → Git, GitHub

• 🧭 DevOps Consultations & Strategy

  → Assess, plan, implement, and scale DevOps practices tailored to your infrastructure and team needs.

Let’s build something that works — and keeps working.
